    <p>
      These Terms govern the use of the mobile game <strong>Golf : Mini</strong> (the “Service”) provided by a
      <strong>solo developer</strong>, DESIGN FUTURE GAMES (the “Company”). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Service Overview & Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      (a) The game provides <strong>no in-app purchases</strong> and <strong>no Google Sign-In</strong>.<br/>
      (b) Advertising is limited to <strong>Google AdMob</strong>: <strong>one interstitial</strong> and
      <strong>two banner placements</strong>. Ad availability/frequency/performance depend on Google policies and network conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Handling Principles</h2>
    <p>
      (a) The Company does not operate its own servers and does not implement a custom account system.<br/>
      (b) The Company <strong>does not directly collect, store, or manage personal data</strong> of users.<br/>
      (c) For ads delivery, <em>Google AdMob SDK</em> may process limited information (e.g., ad identifier, coarse location,
      device information) under Google’s policies/terms. The Company does not control this processing.
      See the <a href="/Golf-Mini/privacy/en.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Use of the Service</h2>
    <p>
      (a) Access may be limited by device performance, OS/store policies, and network environment.<br/>
      (b) The Company may modify or discontinue the Service (including ads) for operational/technical reasons.
      Because there are <strong>no paid purchases</strong>, refund issues do not arise within the app.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
    <p>
      (a) Reverse engineering, decompilation, unauthorized modification/distribution;<br/>
      (b) Cheating, exploiting bugs, or any activity that disrupts operation;<br/>
      (c) Infringing third-party rights (copyrights, trademarks, etc.).
    </p>

    <h2>5. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      (a) The Service is provided <strong>“AS IS”</strong> and <strong>“AS AVAILABLE”</strong> without warranties of any kind,
      express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.<br/>
      (b) To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company shall not be liable for any damages arising from:
      force majeure; user fault; changes in third-party services/policies (including ad networks);
      loss of data/progress; or any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages.<br/>
      (c) In any case, the Company’s total liability shall be limited to the <strong>lowest extent permitted by applicable law</strong>.
      Mandatory consumer protection laws, if applicable, prevail over this clause.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Dispute Avoidance & Resolution</h2>
    <p>
      (a) Before any legal action, the parties shall first attempt to resolve disputes via <strong>informal negotiation for at least 30 days</strong>.<br/>
      (b) These Terms are governed by the laws of the <strong>Republic of Korea</strong>; exclusive jurisdiction lies with the competent court at the Company’s domicile.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to the Terms</h2>
    <p>
      The Company may amend these Terms to the extent permitted by law. Changes will be announced in-app or on the store page and
      take effect on the announced date. Material changes will be notified with a reasonable advance period.
