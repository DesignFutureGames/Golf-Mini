    <p>
      This Policy explains how the <strong>solo developer</strong> DESIGN FUTURE GAMES (the “Company”) handles data in the mobile game
      <strong>Golf : Mini</strong> (the “Service”). The Company operates <strong>no own servers</strong> and aims to <strong>minimize data handling</strong>.
      The game provides <strong>no in-app purchases</strong> and <strong>no Google Sign-In</strong>. Advertising is limited to
      <strong>Google AdMob</strong>: <strong>one interstitial</strong> and <strong>two banner placements</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>1) Data We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>The Company does not directly collect or store any personal data that identifies users.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Local (on-device) storage</em>: Non-identifiable gameplay data such as settings and progress may be stored locally
        (e.g., PlayerPrefs). Deleting the app removes this data.</li>
      <li><em>Third-party ads SDK</em>: For showing ads, <strong>Google AdMob</strong> may process limited information
        (e.g., advertising ID, coarse location, device info, IP-based region, ad performance metrics) under Google’s policies and terms.
        The Company does not control this processing. See:
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads</a>,
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2) Purposes of Processing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ad delivery and measurement (by Google AdMob)</li>
      <li>Maintaining game quality (e.g., OS/store-level crash reporting not directly identifiable by the Company)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Company <strong>does not maintain its own database of user personal data</strong>.</li>
      <li>Local game data on the device is removed when the user deletes the app or clears app data.</li>
      <li>Retention for data processed by Google AdMob follows Google’s policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Sharing & International Transfers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Company does not sell, rent, or transfer user personal data.</li>
      <li>Google AdMob acts as the data processor/controller for ads; international transfers may occur per Google’s policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>On Android, you can reset/remove the advertising ID and limit personalized ads in system settings.</li>
      <li>In certain regions (e.g., EEA), a consent flow (UMP) may be presented at first launch or via an in-app “Privacy Options”
          button (where supported) to manage ad choices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) Children</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is <em>not specifically directed to children</em>. The Company does not knowingly collect children’s personal data.
      The app follows relevant store and Google policies regarding children.
    </p>

    <h2>7) Security</h2>
    <p>
      The Company does not run servers and minimizes on-device data. Security for ads data is governed by Google’s
      technical and organizational measures.
    </p>

    <h2>8) Disclaimer & Liability</h2>
    <p>
      This Policy is provided for transparency and does not constitute legal advice. To the maximum extent permitted by law,
      the Company is not responsible for issues arising from third-party services/policies (including ad networks) or circumstances
      beyond its control. Applicable mandatory consumer protection laws prevail where relevant.
    </p>

    <h2>9) Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>
      The Company may amend this Policy as permitted by law. Changes will be announced in-app or on the store page and take
      effect on the announced date.
